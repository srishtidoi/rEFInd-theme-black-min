## My rEFInd theme

This repository represents my current bootloader theme.

## Usage

1. Copy the entire folder into your rEFInd directory within your EFI partition. (/boot/EFI/refind)
2. Copy the black-min-theme.conf to your rEFInd directory within your EFI partition.
3. Edit your refind.conf file to include the black-min-theme.conf file.

Since rEFInd has no mechanism for a primary title, the title has been baked into the banner (background) file. The .xcf file can be modified and used as
background. 

## Attribution

from  . The icons have been taken from the following sources:
